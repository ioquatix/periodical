# Periodical

Periodical is a simple framework for working with durations and periods. A duration measures a range of time bounded by a `from` date and `to` date. A period is a relative unit of time such as `4 weeks`.

## Motivation

The original idea for this library came from a [Python script which performed backup rotation](http://www.scottlu.com/Content/Snapfilter.html) from 2009. In particular, I thought it had a novel way to retain backups according to a given policy (e.g. one backup every year for 10 years, one backup every month for 12 months, one backup every week for 8 weeks, one backup every day for 30 days). This is done by constructing a special slot based hash structure with keys based on the date being stored. This functionality is used by [LSync](https://github.com/ioquatix/LSync) for performing backup rotation (i.e. deleting old backups).

In addition, I had a need to implement periodical billing in [Financier](https://github.com/ioquatix/financier). Not only can this gem advance a date by a given period, it can compute the number of periods between two dates. This is useful for invoicing, say, once every 6 months for a weekly or monthly service.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

	gem 'periodical'

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install periodical

## Usage

The main use case for this framework involves periodic billing or accounting (e.g. calculating fortnightly rental payments).

	duration = Periodical::Duration.new(Date.parse("2010-01-01"), Date.parse("2010-02-01"))
	period = Periodical::Period.new(2, :weeks)
	
	# How many periods in the duration?
	count = duration / period
	
	# Calculate the date which is 2 * (2 weeks)
	next = period.advance(duration.from, 2)
